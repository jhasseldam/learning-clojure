# Clojure from scratch

My personal notebook while exploring Clojure

## Setup

To run Clojure on your Mac, you need the following
- JVM (brew install openjdk)
- Visual Studio Code (brew install --cask visual-studio-code)
- Clojure (brew install clojure)

To fully take advantage of the REPL in Clojure you have to install the Calva pluging for VsCode.

Now run `Calva: Start a project REPL and connect`, choose *Leiningen* and you are good to go.

Choose `option + enter` to evaluate a Clojure expression
